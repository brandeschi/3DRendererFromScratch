This codebase is the result of working through the following course: [3D Computer Graphics Programming](https://pikuma.com/courses/learn-3d-computer-graphics-programming). The core concepts taught in the course have been implemented with room left to clean up the code. The models used in the course have not been included as I do not own them, but the renderer works with any Wavefront OBJ file. One thing I might update is how models and textures are loaded into the program.
